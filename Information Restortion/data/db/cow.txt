THE COW



THE Cow is too well known, I fear,

To need an introduction here.

If She should vanish from earth's face

It would be hard to fill her place;

For with the Cow would disappear

So much that everyone holds Dear.

Oh, think of all the Boots and Shoes,

Milk Punches, Gladstone Bags and Stews,

And Things too numerous to count,

Of which, my child, she is the Fount.

Let's hope, at least, the Fount may last

Until our Generation's past.
