HOW BEAUTY CONTRIVED TO GET SQUARE WITH THE BEAST



ISS Guinevere Platt

Was so beautiful that

She couldn't remember the day

When one of her swains

Hadn't taken the pains

To send her a mammoth bouquet.

And the postman had found,

On the whole of his round,

That no one received such a lot

Of bulky epistles

As, waiting his whistles,

The beautiful Guinevere got!

 

A significant sign

That her charm was divine

Was seen in society, when

The chaperons sniffed

With their eyebrows alift:

"Whatever's got into the men?" 

There was always a man

Who was holding her fan,

And twenty that danced in details, 

And a couple of mourners,

Who brooded in corners,

And gnawed their mustaches and nails.

 

John Jeremy Platt

Wouldn't stay in the flat,

For his beautiful daughter he missed:

When he'd taken his tub,

He would hie to his club,

And dally with poker or whist. 

At the end of a year

It was perfectly clear

That he'd never computed the cost, 

For he hadn't a penny

To settle the many

Ten thousands of dollars he'd lost!

 

F. Ferdinand Fife

Was a student of life:

He was coarse, and excessively fat, 

With a beard like a goat's,

But he held all the notes

Of ruined John Jeremy Platt! 

With an adamant smile

That was brimming with guile,

He said: "I am took with the face 

Of your beautiful daughter,

And wed me she ought ter,

To save you from utter disgrace!"

 

Miss Guinevere Platt 

Didn't hesitate at

Her duty's imperative call. 

When they looked at the bride 

All the chaperons cried:

"She isn't so bad, after all!"

Of the desolate men 

There were something like ten

Who took up political lives, 

And the flower of the flock 

Went and fell off a dock,

And the rest married hideous wives!

 

But the beautiful wife 

Of F. Ferdinand Fife

Was the wildest that ever was known:

She'd grumble and glare, 

Till the man didn't dare

To say that his soul was his own. 

She sneered at his ills,

And quadrupled his bills,

And spent nearly twice what he earned; 

Her husband deserted,

And frivoled, and flirted,

Till Ferdinand's reason was turned.

 

He repented too late,

And his terrible fate

Upon him so heavily sat,

That he swore at the day

When he sat down to play

At cards with John Jeremy Platt.

He was dead in a year,

And the fair Guinevere

In society sparkled again,

While the chaperons fluttered

Their fans, as they muttered:

"She's getting exceedingly plain!"

The Moral: Predicaments often are found

That beautiful duty is apt to get round:

But greedy extortioners better beware

For dutiful beauty is apt to get square!
